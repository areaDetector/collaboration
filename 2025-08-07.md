# areaDetector Collaboration Meeting (2025-08-07)

## Attendance

## Previous meeting action points

- Jakub: ADAndor3 CoaXpress camera, issues with BitFlow driver (didn't build on RHEL, didn't support DKMS, instructions from Andor were complex and required manual work). Does it work with Euresys? Might require vendor specific code, like Hamamatsu (doesn't implement GenICam completely, only 3 parameters - they want you to use their own library, since they have other interfaces, such as CameraLink, which won't support GenICam), otherwise it should work.

- Jakub will ask Stuart Wilkins about maintenance of specsAnalyzer and see if it's still in use
