# areaDetector collaboration meeting

## Collaboration
- Would [Github stale bot](https://github.com/actions/stale) be interesting? It marks/comments an issue/PR as stale after 60 days of inactivity and closes it after 14 more days of inactivity, will do after this meeting. Investigate if it can be selective about issues.
- Initial profiling of a generic AD pipeline: SimDetector+PROC+ROI+TR
    - Frame rate around 194hz (period set to .005), frame size 1280x960
    - Perf+FlameGraph result: ![perf](2024-07-04/perf.svg)
    This seems to indicate a lot of time spent memcopying inside the NDArray destructor, I will investigate further. I intend to profile a more realistic pipeline, e.g. 2MB frame at 560hz or something that could saturate a 40Gb/s link
    I will add enough information in the collaboration repo to reproduce the test (see [here](2024-07-04/))
    Investigate how to add more debug symbols.
- Improve autogenerated list of issues and PRs, to avoid long lists, we will filter last fetched and include ones modified recently
