# areaDetector collaboration meeting

## Collaboration
- What is the process for merging pull requests? requiring n approvers?
    - So far Mark has merged, sometimes assiging reviewers based on knowledge of others areas of expertise. We have actions that test build on some repos. Desirable to extend this to all repos, but might not be possible in some vendor private situations.
    - No legal review at the moment, sometimes need email confirmation from vendors that we can put the repo out there.
    - With windows we put up the .h and .lib files so we can build, but not the .dll so it won't run without the vendor SDK installed
    - We should review the list of owners in the org
    - The list of owners for specific repos is sometimes different too
    - Suggest the process is to ask for review from the maintainer of the repo
    - Suspect that 1 review is sufficient, although for complex cases we may want more than 1
    - Suggest we start informal, then add policies or automation when we have tried it out
    - Need automated "reminder" process setup
    - Can add CODEOWNERS file when we decide who is reponsible
- ACTION: people to suggest for the next meeting who should be owners at the org/detector level and what they are able to contribute
    - Mark to make Emilio an owner for now, then decide on everyone else in the next meeting
- Is it different for specific detectors vs ADCore?
    - Yes, detectors have been maintained by those who have originally contributed sometimes
- Who should be owner on the areaDetector repositories?
    - As above

## Issues and pull requests
- Timestamps and timestamp sources:
    - [ADAravis#25]( https://github.com/areaDetector/ADAravis/pull/25), [ADEiger#62](https://github.com/areaDetector/ADEiger/pull/62), [ADAndor3#16](https://github.com/areaDetector/ADAndor3/pull/16), [ADAndor#58](https://github.com/areaDetector/ADAndor/pull/58)
    - Noticed that there could be some common behaviour here
    - Aravis has 3 possible sources:
        - The camera (possibly time from power on or PTP)
        - The system timestamp when the first part of frame was received
        - The EPICS timestamp when the NDArray was created
    - LCLS uses lower order bits of EPICSTimeStamp to encode event number
        - https://github.com/areaDetector/ADCore/blob/9d2c32a210408cdc353331a4353a0b416d95444a/documentation/areaDetectorTimeStampSupport.html#L34
    - EPICS timestamp uses different epoch to UNIX epoch
    - We should keep EPICS timestamp to have its current meaning
    - We could also add attributes to add these additional timestamps
    - These attributes can get their value from a custom function, e.g. getting timestamp
    - ACTION: Joshua to take a look at this and report back next meeting
- ACTION: people to look at release notes for upcoming ADCore release
- Auto-connect feature:
    - [ADAravis#27](https://github.com/areaDetector/ADAravis/pull/27)
    - Is there a standard way? should this even be implemented?
    - AsynManager will call periodically "connect", if the underlying port is disconnected. Driver has to call disconnect() to start this behaviour.
    - https://github.com/areaDetector/ADPylon/blob/master/pylonApp/src/ADPylon.cpp
    - an issue found about asyn autoconnect https://github.com/epics-modules/asyn/issues/186

## AOB
- v3/v7 long-term support
