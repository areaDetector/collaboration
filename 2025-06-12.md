# areaDetector Collaboration Meeting (2025-06-12)

## Action points

- See if PyDM autoconvert can be added to autoconvert recipe: https://anaconda.org/conda-forge/adl2pydm , as pointed out in ADAravis#34
- Open issues/PRs specifying PV behavior more explicitly
    - Acquire -> people should use the busy callback
    - "Detector is ready for triggers" -> ARMED PV? Acquire_RBV?
- Find owners (contact points) for drivers and define obsolete drivers sent to tech-talk: https://epics.anl.gov/tech-talk/2025/msg00536.php
    - Mark will respond to the email with further suggestions: https://epics.anl.gov/tech-talk/2025/msg00646.php
    - Diamond might take up ADAravis
