- ADCore:
    - PRs:
        - [x] [Convert NDPluginPva to use PVXS](https://github.com/areaDetector/ADCore/pull/532) - changes from issues noticed when testing with [pvxsDriver](https://github.com/jsouter/pvxsDriver)
- ADSupport:
    - PRs:
        - [x] [Build module with MingW (and other compilers) with Ubuntu host on our GitLab server.](https://github.com/areaDetector/ADSupport/pull/39) - help wanted from anyone who uses MinGW to check and test
- ADAndor3:
    - Issues:
        - [x] [Provide updated tag](https://github.com/areaDetector/ADAndor3/issues/18) - library situation seems to be fine, just need to tag
- ADCompVision:
    - Issues:
        - [ ] [Convert vision functions to readEnum, so we only need to define them in the code.](https://github.com/areaDetector/ADCompVision/issues/46)
        - [ ] [Centroid Y coordinate reversed in AD coordinate system](https://github.com/areaDetector/ADCompVision/issues/45)
    - PRs:
        - [ ] [Add warp perspective function](https://github.com/areaDetector/ADCompVision/pull/47) - needs review
- ADEiger:
    - Issues:
        - [x] [Eiger2 MEDM Counting Mode is flipped](https://github.com/areaDetector/ADEiger/issues/75) - Tejas will take a look to confirm if it's an IOC or MEDM issue, Mark mentioned he could take a look as well
- ADHamamatsuDCAM:
    - Issues:
        - [x] [Driver doesn't use Acquire Period](https://github.com/areaDetector/ADHamamatsuDCAM/issues/11) - possibly implement fallback to software acquisition loop (and try to inform user about it!)
            - Leave comment about this and/or open new issue
        - [ ] [COPYFRAME strategy is defined at compile time](https://github.com/areaDetector/ADHamamatsuDCAM/issues/9)
        - [ ] [Driver should determine whether a property is supported before trying to access it.](https://github.com/areaDetector/ADHamamatsuDCAM/issues/3)
- ADUVC:
    - Issues:
        - [x] [Implement digital binning and ROI selection](https://github.com/areaDetector/ADUVC/issues/53)
            - Discussed other implementation options: existing warm-up, improve lazy open (if necessary), add more lazy functionality to Bluesky
            - Intention is to remove the warm-up as an optimization (which might not work for all drivers)
            - Open/move issue to ADCore for the discussion that pertains to all drivers
- ADViewers:
    - PRs:
        - [x] [Image j macros](https://github.com/areaDetector/ADViewers/pull/21)
- Stale Items:
    - Stale Issues:
        - [ ] [Find a way to stop misbehaving plugins from slowing down driver](https://github.com/areaDetector/ADCore/issues/98)
        - [x] [Create mixer plugin](https://github.com/areaDetector/ADCore/issues/236)
            - Jakub and Mark: the problem mentioned by the issue can be implemented as a combination of Gather and Process plugins, using the N/N-1 functionality
            - Mark: a mixer plugin could go further by implementing things like geometry aggregation from detectors with separate data streams (such as Lambda)
        - [ ] [NDFileNexus problem](https://github.com/areaDetector/ADCore/issues/264)
