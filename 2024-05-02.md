# areaDetector collaboration meeting

## Collaboration

- How to organize clean up of outdated issues and PRs
   - We could have a rule in which if a PR/issue doesn't show activity for N months, we close it
       - Maybe automated by a bot to mention participants
  - ACTION: is there an automated way to extract all open issues/PR?
- Performance considerations
    - Blocking vs non-blocking mode: non-blocking mode should be preferred
    - Should we not copy by default? Investigate alternative ways to handle it
    - Has anyone done profiling on AD plugins? investigate profiling options
    - ADPython replacement based on shared memory: [ADExternal](https://github.com/dls-controls/ADExternal)
- Integrating parallelHDF into NDHDF5
- If anyone is interested, pvapy has streaming framework which can also be used for parallel file writes: https://github.com/epics-base/pvaPy/blob/master/documentation/streamingFramework.md
In particular, here is the example of what is possible: https://github.com/epics-base/pvaPy/blob/master/documentation/streamingFramework.md#processing-chains
