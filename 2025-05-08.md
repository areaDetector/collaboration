# areaDetector Collaboration Meeting (2025-05-08)

## Attendance

## Previous meeting action points

- Small documentation and typo changes don't need PRs, but code changes can have them
- Open issues/PRs specifying PV behavior more explicitly
    - Acquire -> people should use the busy callback
    - "Detector is ready for triggers" -> ARMED PV? Acquire_RBV?
- Send list of issues/PRs to tech-talk to bring interested people into meeting
- Find owners (contact points) for drivers and define obsolete drivers **to be sent on tech-talk**
    - Diamond might take up ADAravis
    - Even so, merging PRs doesn't have to depend on the owner; code review can come from anyone, and the author has presumably tested it
- Releases are made when someone needs a new feature or driver change, or when changes have accumulated
    - Update all drivers to master
    - Tag ADCore and top-level areaDetector simultaneously
- Inclusion of new drivers
    - Include documentation
    - Code quality
    - Build out of the box if possible
    - Generality (can other people use it?)
- Help required: fix ADCore CI **DONE!**
