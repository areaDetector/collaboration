- Wang Xiaoqiang
- Qun Zhang
- Kevin Peterson
- Gustavo Reis
- Josh EC
- Elaine Chandler
- Mark Engbretson

## Previous meeting action points

- Small documentation and typo changes don't need PRs, but code changes can have them
- Open issues/PRs specifying PV behavior more explicitly
    - Acquire -> people should use the busy callback
    - "Detector is ready for triggers" -> ARMED PV? Acquire_RBV?
- Send list of issues/PRs to tech-talk to bring interested people into meeting
- Find owners (contact points) for drivers and define obsolete drivers **sent to tech-talk: https://epics.anl.gov/tech-talk/2025/msg00536.php**
    - Diamond might take up ADAravis **no updates on this**
    - Even so, merging PRs doesn't have to depend on the owner; code review can come from anyone, and the author has presumably tested it
- Releases are made when someone needs a new feature or driver change, or when changes have accumulated
    - Update all drivers to master
    - Tag ADCore and top-level areaDetector simultaneously
- Inclusion of new drivers
    - Include documentation
    - Code quality
    - Build out of the box if possible
    - Generality (can other people use it?)
- Help required: fix ADCore CI **DONE!**

## Issues

- areaDetector:
    - PRs:
        - [x] [Add ADPimega as a submodule (branch: lumentum-v3)](https://github.com/areaDetector/areaDetector/pull/95) - Let Lumentum know about remaining issues (PR was for master branch)
- ADCore:
    - Issues:
        - [x] [Out of bounds read/type confusion in compressed arrays with NDPluginStdArrays, can cause segmentation fault](https://github.com/areaDetector/ADCore/issues/531) - try to document the limitations from this use case, see what can be done regarding out-of-bounds reads
        - [x] [Convert NDPluginPva to use PVXS](https://github.com/areaDetector/ADCore/issues/528)
    - PRs:
        - [x] [Convert NDPluginPva to use PVXS](https://github.com/areaDetector/ADCore/pull/532)
- ADEiger:
    - Issues:
        - [x] [The lz4 data in Stream2 is different from Stream](https://github.com/areaDetector/ADEiger/issues/69)
        - [x] [Driver is copying data twice for each frame in Stream mode, not efficient](https://github.com/areaDetector/ADEiger/issues/68)
        - [x] [Support Stream2 CBOR format and multiple threshold frames](https://github.com/areaDetector/ADEiger/issues/65) - what's the best interface? split into channels for current viewers supporting only 2 dimensions, try to transform into RGB image, look into new viewers with support for more dimensions?
- ADLambda:
    - Issues:
        - [x] [Probable bug in driver](https://github.com/areaDetector/ADLambda/issues/13) - updating parameter values (including ADAcquire) and calling frame callbacks seems to happen in different threads/control flows, probably causing this issue
- ADPICam:
    - PRs:
        - [x] [Implement pulse parameters and re-populate enums after a parameter is marked as existing](https://github.com/areaDetector/ADPICam/pull/26) - someone needs to review this code
- ADPcoWin:
    - Issues:
        - [x] [Linux support?](https://github.com/areaDetector/ADPcoWin/issues/24) - installation on Linux is more complicated than on Windows, but everyone is interested in getting it working on Linux. Wang's driver is less complex than ADPcoWin
- ADPilatus:
    - PRs:
        - [x] [Check for 7 OK message when waiting for an image to actualy end the acquisition](https://github.com/areaDetector/ADPilatus/pull/17) - pending testing
- collaboration:
    - PRs:
        - [x] [Update `get-issues-and-prs.py` script.](https://github.com/areaDetector/collaboration/pull/1) - will be merged in ~1wk
- Stale Items:
    - Stale Issues:
        - [x] [HDF5 plugin feature where datasets with type=constant is broken](https://github.com/areaDetector/ADCore/issues/36) - pending testing to confirm still an issue
        - [x] [Find a way to stop misbehaving plugins from slowing down driver](https://github.com/areaDetector/ADCore/issues/98) - can likely be closed after documenting expected plugin behavior
        - [x] [HDF5 NDAttribute datasets to support "extra" dimensions like detector datasets](https://github.com/areaDetector/ADCore/issues/96) - is it still necessary?
        - [x] [Expand CI services to cover more configurations](https://github.com/areaDetector/ADCore/issues/115) - do we really need to cover 32-bit? Is AD relevant there?
        - [x] [option to not write NDAttr* attributes in HDF5 dataset](https://github.com/areaDetector/ADCore/issues/145) - can probably be closed, issue author has resigned to it
        - [x] [MEDM slider behaves badly on some Windows systems](https://github.com/areaDetector/ADPhotron/issues/6) - repository will be archived
        - [x] [Allow use of the 2nd ethernet port of the SA-Z for data transfer](https://github.com/areaDetector/ADPhotron/issues/7) - repository will be archived
    - Stale PRs:
        - [x] [prosilica.cpp:](https://github.com/areaDetector/ADProsilica/pull/4) - stale updates, timestamp feature has been implemented in asyn
        - [x] [Added new prosilica resend params and rates for packet counts](https://github.com/areaDetector/ADProsilica/pull/7) - ADVimba already has this
        - [x] [Added driver support for NDBitsPerPixel and NDBytesPerPixel parameters](https://github.com/areaDetector/ADProsilica/pull/8) - feature likely won't be added to ADCore
        - [x] [Added redef of Gain in prosilica.template so we can set driver limits](https://github.com/areaDetector/ADProsilica/pull/5) - ADVimba has this
        - [x] [FIX: call start() after NDEdgePlugin object is created for plugin to work for ADCore >= 2.5,  don't process plugin if input NDArray dimension > 2 (i.e. for Color modes)](https://github.com/areaDetector/ADPluginEdge/pull/3) - try to review code, seems simple enough
        - [x] [Slac edl](https://github.com/areaDetector/ADCore/pull/316) - likely outdated, don't know if it makes sense to include custom GUIs in repository
        - [x] [Applied bitsPerPixel.patch to bring in bitsPerPixel support from pcds…](https://github.com/areaDetector/ADCore/pull/314) - feature likely won't be added to ADCore
